(2) INTRODUCTION
-----------------
BaRT is an open-source `VM Managementâ€™ resource enabling users to manage NTNX VM elements through RESTful control (allows the flexible use of REST API commands, relative addressing, macros, libraries, and bash programs).

BaRT is a bash-shell program which runs from shell command line and can be integrated with 3rd party scripts or runctimes directly.

BaRT will run on most platform(s) having a working Bash v3.2 installation or higher. However, there may of course be minor differences across various linux distributions.

BaRT has been tested using Mac OSX, 10.12.4 and BSD/Linux which the author(s) are familiar with. Feedback regarding installation and usage on other distributions would be greatly appreciated, followed by future updates (as needed).


(3) HISTORY
-----------
BaRT is designed for Tech Summit 2017 as a guide for particiapnts to stand-up VM configurations on a Nutanix Cluster. BaRT is implemented in Bash in order to (a) greatly improve its utility, and (b) to make it available to the wide range of platforms which run Bash.
